# sCRBle

Back-end code for the sCRBle game (it's just scrabble).

## Why ?

I wanted to play this with some people over the internet but I didn't find any great websites to play it

## How to set up ?

Follow this complicated one step setup:

1. `deno run --allow-net --allow-read src/index.ts`

Optionally, set `PORT` to a different value.
